Fully custom remote controlled car. Specced and sourced all componenets, ensuring mechanical and electrical compatibaility. Designed car assembly and modeled all components. 3D printed chassis, steering mechanism, and component mounts. Assembled the car and safely integrated the electronics. Programmed car and remote control with ESP-NOW communication and IMU-based motion control.

### 4. Code
Firmware for motor control, sensors, and any automation.

[Folder: code](code/)

Includes:
- RC motor control scripts
- Sensor integration (if applicable)
- Instructions for uploading/running code

---

### Notes
- CAD models created in SolidWorks; STEP file included for universal viewing.  
- Real-life photos and videos demonstrate assembly and functionality.  
- Images and diagrams highlight design decisions and subsystem integration.  
- All files organized for clarity and easy navigation.

### Optional: Features / Highlights (if you want)
- Lightweight chassis optimized for balance and rigidity  
- Servo-driven steering with minimal bump steer  
- Modular motor and battery mounts for easy maintenance  
- Demonstrates full mechanical and electrical integration in a student project
