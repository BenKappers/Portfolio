Fully custom remote controlled car. Specced and sourced all componenets, ensuring mechanical and electrical compatibaility. Designed car assembly and modeled all components. 3D printed chassis, steering mechanism, and component mounts. Assembled the car and safely integrated the electronics. Programmed car and remote control with ESP-NOW communication and IMU-based motion control.

### 1. Mechanical
Created a full CAD design of the car assembly. STEP file of the full assembly is available [HERE](CAD/RCCarAssembly.STEP)

Designed and 3D printed mounts for the battery, driver motor, and ESP32.
Designed and 3D printed the chassis with accurate mounting locations.
