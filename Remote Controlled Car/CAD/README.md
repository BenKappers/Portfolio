  Complete RC car showing drivetrain, steering, and electronics layout.

  
- **Drivetrain assembly**
  
  ![Drivetrain Assembly](Images/DrivingAssembly.png)
  Motor, gear reduction, and axle layout. Gears and axle hub were 3D printed in PLA

  
- **Steering assembly**
  
  ![Steering Assembly](Images/SteeringAssembly.png)
  Servo-driven steering mechanism with linkages around wheel size and desired turning radius. Crank, knuckles, and tie rod were 3D printed in PLA.
  
- **Chassis**
  
  ![Chassis](Images/Chassis.png)

  Primary load-bearing structure, designed for rigidity while minimizing mass. Supports all subsystems and mounting points. 3D printed in PLA.
  
- **Motor mount**
  
  ![Motor Mount](Images/MotorMount.png)

  Fixes the motor to the chassis of the car. Resists reaction torque from the motor. 3D printed in PLA.
  
- **Battery mount**
  
  ![Battery Mount](Images/BatteryMount.png)

  Fixes the battery to the chassis of the car. 3D printed in PLA.

## Notes

- CAD models were created in SolidWorks.
- STEP file included for viewing; native SolidWorks files are available upon request.
- Screenshots highlight key subsystems and components.
