# Centrifugal Pump CAD Project

## Overview
This project involved designing and modeling a fully assembled centrifugal pump in CAD.  
The model includes all major components such as the casing, impeller, shaft, bearing housing, and sealing features.  
The goal was to accurately represent mechanical fit, assembly relationships, and internal flow geometry typical of an end-suction centrifugal pump.
